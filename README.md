# Study Popularity of Programming Languages
This project analyzes the rise and fall of programming languages over time. The goal is to identify trends in programming language popularity and understand the factors that contribute to their rise or fall.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Programming Languages Dataset, which consists of data from the StackExchange querytool. The dataset has been preprocessed and cleaned for use in this project, and is contained in the PL_DataSet.csv file.

# Methodology
The analysis is done using Python 3 and several popular data analysis libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. The dataset is loaded and preprocessed to extract the relevant information, and then visualizations are created to analyze the trends in programming language popularity over time.

# Code
The code for this project is contained in the Rise and Fall in Programming Languages.ipynb Jupyter notebook. The notebook is divided into several sections, including data loading and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, data visualization and forecasting the popularity of these languages using time series/ARIMA forecasting. Each section includes detailed explanations of the code and its functionality.

# Results
The results of the analysis are presented in the notebook using interactive visualizations that show the rise and fall of programming languages over time. The analysis also includes a discussion of the factors that contribute to the popularity of programming languages.

# Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into the popularity of programming languages over time, which can help developers make informed decisions about which languages to learn and use. The code and results can be easily replicated or modified for use in other programming language popularity analysis projects.
